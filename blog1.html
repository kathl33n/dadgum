    <h2>What day is it??</h2>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>I haven't kept track of how many days it has been for us being home, and being cautious. It's such a crazy time we're living in right now. We have our baby to protect, but at the same time we have to go out and make money so we can pay the bills while this is all happening. I am grateful that I'm not alone in this, and that my fiance is who he is. He has been able to take care of our family despite facing all this uncertaity. He is such an amazing dad to our baby, and when he isn't working from home, he watches him so I can go and work. It's definitely a team effort, and I love him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today I went to do our laundry with gloves, and a mask on. It wasn't as busy, but the few people that were there were NOT staying 6ft away. That stressed me out. If we didn't have the baby, I may not be as stressed seeing that, but since we do I am extra vigilent. I get irritated, and sort of back away from someone who gets right next to me to use a dryer when there are literally 50 other empty available dryers they could use. I want to ask them "yo! do you WATCH the news?!" but I just back up, stare at them until they move, then go back to what I was doing. </p>
    <br>
    <p>My fiance teaches from home right now, and as long as people keep taking lessons we're okay. Today one of his regular students had to drop, and I know that has to be disappointing. I hope this doesn't last much longer, or I guess I should say I hope things don't get worse.</p>
