    <h2>Trauma and self-care</h2>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <div class="entry">
    <p>It's been said that "individuals who survived traumatic childhoods may subconsciously view themselves as unworthy of healthy habits and
    lifestyle choices." I can relate to that. I spent my 20's feeling very much like that. I made unhealthy lifestyle choices, and to this day I am re-progamming myself to not do that anymore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Self care is more than physical, it's alot of work emotionally too. I have been working very hard to recover emotionally from toxic work environments, as well as toxic relationships. Both instances I felt like I had no choice but to endure them, or put up with them, until one day I put myself first and ended them. I quit a job that I was at for over 10 years and hated. I cut people out of my life that I let take advantage of me, or stress me out, or make me feel responsible for their bullshit when it wasn't mine to own.
    I became more self aware, and also vigilent of anyone who tried to manipulate me with guilt trips, or criticism. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>What I struggle with now is worry and fear. I'm learning how to overcome the anxieties without leaning on the coping mechanisms I had before. I'm learning healthy ways of working through things.
        <br>
         Writing about them is definitely a new way of getting things out even if it is just to myself. I used to not because I cared too much about someone possibly reading them. Everyone has their own issues, no one is in any position to judge. I respect anyone who has the courage to work on themselves, or seek therapy. It's just as important as going to the gym, or brushing your teeth. If you don't address the issues inside yourself, then they effect people around you, and the relationships you have. 
        <br>
        There are alot of people who refuse to take ownership of any wrong doing, and instead are defensive, and blame everyone else for their problems. I don't want to be that person.</p>
