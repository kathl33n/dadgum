    <h2>Remember to breathe</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>Having bills to pay during a pandemic is stressful. Most companies will work with you, and extend your due date, or meet you in the middle. When one of them tries to come back at you with a "we already worked with you once, and we really can't keep pushing back your payments" when there is a Stay Home order in effect and I can't work like I was until the 30th of this month, it puts me in a worried funk. Some people live paycheck to paycheck, and for someone to expect payments during a time when we literally cannot work seems so unfair, and unreasonable. At a certain point, there just isn't anything I can do but communicate, and hope for leniency, and prepare to work very hard to pay things off once I'm able to again. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I also put pressure on myself to study, and learn these programming languages while we have all this time at home. I keep thinking about our future, and how I don't want us to struggle like we are. It can become counter productive when I worry about how much I <em>Still</em> need to learn in order to get my first job and I feel overwhelemed by it. I have to keep telling myself to take things one thing at a time, and perfect one thing before moving on to the next thing. I need to be patient with myself when learning new things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I should control what I <em>can</em> control, and focus on investing the time I have into learning new things that will benefit us in the future. I need to remember to breathe. 
    <br>
    My fiance had to keep reminding me to breathe when I was in serious pain during labor with our son. I never knew you hold your breath like that when you're hurting but you do!
    It's not just a cliche to say "remember to breathe" because in stressful, or painful times you really don't think to. </p>
